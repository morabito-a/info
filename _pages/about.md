In my most recent role, I held the position of Research Associate at the Technology Platform of Hydraulic Machines at EPFL, Switzerland. I specialized in analytical and numerical modeling for hydropower plant operations, focusing on hydraulic short-circuit analysis for pumped-storage plants partecipating in the recent energy markets. Previously, as an Energy Engineer, Industrial Collaborator & Consultant at ULB, Belgium, I was engaged in multiple applied energy projects focusing on optimization, flexibility and sustainability. 
I hold a Ph.D. in Engineering Sciences, a M.Sc. degree in Science of Management and a M.Sc. degree in Energy Engineering.
